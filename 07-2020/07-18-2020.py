# A rule looks like this:

# A NE B

# This means this means point A is located northeast of point B.

# A SW C

# means that point A is southwest of C.

# Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate. For example:

# A N B
# B NE C
# C N A
# does not validate, since A cannot be both north and south of C.

# A NW B
# A N B
# is considered valid.
