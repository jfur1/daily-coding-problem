# A competitive runner would like to create a route that starts and ends at his house,
# with the condition that the route goes entirely uphill at first, and then entirely downhill.

# Given a dictionary of places of the form {location: elevation}, 
# and a dictionary mapping paths between some of these locations to their corresponding distances, 
# find the length of the shortest route satisfying the condition above. Assume the runner's home is location 0.

# For example, suppose you are given the following input:

# elevations = {0: 5, 1: 25, 2: 15, 3: 20, 4: 10}
# paths = {
#     (0, 1): 10,
#     (0, 2): 8,
#     (0, 3): 15,
#     (1, 3): 12,
#     (2, 4): 10,
#     (3, 4): 5,
#     (3, 0): 17,
#     (4, 0): 10
# }
# In this case, the shortest valid path would be 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 0, with a distance of 28.
