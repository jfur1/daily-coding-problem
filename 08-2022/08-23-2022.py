# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Amazon.

# Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

# For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".

# Python program to find the longest substring with k unique
# characters in a given string
MAX_CHARS = 26
 
# This function calculates number of unique characters
# using a associative array count[]. Returns true if
# no. of characters are less than required else returns
# false.
def isValid(count, k):
    val = 0
    for i in range(MAX_CHARS):
        if count[i] > 0:
            val += 1
 
    # Return true if k is greater than or equal to val
    return (k >= val)
 
# Finds the maximum substring with exactly k unique characters
def kUniques(s, k):
    u = 0 # number of unique characters
    n = len(s)
 
    # Associative array to store the count
    count = [0] * MAX_CHARS
 
    # Traverse the string, fills the associative array
    # count[] and count number of unique characters
    for i in range(n):
        if count[ord(s[i])-ord('a')] == 0:
            u += 1
        count[ord(s[i])-ord('a')] += 1
 
    # If there are not enough unique characters, show
    # an error message.
    if u < k:
        print ("Not enough unique characters")
        return
 
    # Otherwise take a window with first element in it.
    # start and end variables.
    curr_start = 0
    curr_end = 0
 
    # Also initialize values for result longest window
    max_window_size = 1
    max_window_start = 0
 
    # Initialize associative array count[] with zero
    count = [0] * len(count)
 
    count[ord(s[0])-ord('a')] += 1 # put the first character
 
    # Start from the second character and add
    # characters in window according to above
    # explanation
    for i in range(1,n):
 
        # Add the character 's[i]' to current window
        count[ord(s[i])-ord('a')] += 1
        curr_end+=1
 
        # If there are more than k unique characters in
        # current window, remove from left side
        while not isValid(count, k):
            count[ord(s[curr_start])-ord('a')] -= 1
            curr_start += 1
 
        # Update the max window size if required
        if curr_end-curr_start+1 > max_window_size:
            max_window_size = curr_end-curr_start+1
            max_window_start = curr_start
