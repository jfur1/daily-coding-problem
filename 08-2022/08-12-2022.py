# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Uber.

# Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

# For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

# Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

# Brute Force: Nested loop to calculate product for each index
# Runtime: O(N^2)
# Aux Space: O(N)

    newArr = []

            if i == j: continue
            if val is None: 
                val = nums[j]
            else:
                val *= nums[j]
                
        newArr.append(val)
